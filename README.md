2. ## Testing

## Functionality testing 

 I used Chrome developer tools throughout the project for testing for responsiveness of mobile and desktop. I also used [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/) and [Microsoft Edge](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/edge) to test the funcionality of the website on desktop and mobile compatibility using these websites developer tools.
 
 [Chrome DevTools](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/) was helpfull throughout the development of this website.


## Compatibility testing

[Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse) was helpfull throughout the development of this website for mobile and desktop compatibility.
 
This project was developed using a HP Pavilion laptop with Windows 11 Home and used also a Samsung 24 inch monitor. I also used my Huawei P30 Pro mobile to check the sites compatibility.

## Performance testing

I run [Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/) tool to check performance of the website.

Below are the final performance results received for compatibility in Lighthouse.
